# House Prices Prediction Using Advanced Regression Techniques
*Note: This repository shares the group project in fulfillment of the Data Analytics class for Data Science coursework.*

## Work Summary

## Objectives

## Data Sources
- The historical house pricing data used for this work was prepared by Dean De Cock in 2011, which was made publicly available in conjunction with the Kaggle’s GettingStarted Prediction Competition to encourage Data Scientist’s contribution in employing feature engineering and advanced regression techniques that help generate input for house pricing prediction. 
- For practice purposes, we adopted the **<ins>train.csv</ins>** data set, which contains details of 1460 residential homes sold from 2006 to 2010 in Ames, Iowa, United States, with prices ranging between $34,900 and $755,000. 
- In this work, we omitted using the **<ins>test.csv</ins>** data set as the actual house prices were not explicitly available for performance evaluation. The train set was renamed **<ins>Ames House Prices.csv</ins>**, consisting of 1460 observations and 81 variables (38 numerical and 43 categorical). 
- The target variable is **<ins>SalePrice</ins>** which displays the selling price of the house.
